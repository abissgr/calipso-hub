/**
 * In a standard web application, the authentication process may be
 * automatically triggered when the client tries to access a secured resource
 * without being authenticated – this is usually done by redirecting to a login
 * page so that the user can enter credentials. However, for a RESTful Web
 * Service this behavior doesn’t make much sense – authentication should only be
 * done by a request to the correct URI and all other requests should simply
 * fail with a 401 UNAUTHORIZED status code if the user is not authenticated.
 * 
 * Spring Security handles this automatic triggering of the authentication
 * process with the concept of an entry point; the entry point is a required
 * part of the configuration, and can be injected via the entry-point-ref
 * attribute of the <http> element. Keeping in mind that this functionality
 * doesn’t make sense in the context of the RESTful web service, the new custom
 * entry point is defined:
